  <p>
    [Refrain]
    So close, no matter how far
    Couldn't be much more from the heart
    Forever trusting who we are
    And nothing else matters

    [Verse 1]
    Never opened myself this way
    Life is ours, we live it our way
    All these words, I don't just say
    And nothing else matters
    Trust I seek and I find in you
    Every day for us something new
    Open mind for a different view
    And nothing else matters

    [Chorus]
    Never cared for what they do
    Never cared for what they know
    But I know

    [Refrain]
    So close, no matter how far
    It couldn't be much more from the heart
    Forever trusting who we are
    And nothing else matters

    [Chorus]
    Never cared for what they do
    Never cared for what they know
    But I know

    Never cared for games they play
    Never cared for what they do
    Never cared for what they know
